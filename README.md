Ever since my adolescence, I have never confined myself to being a bookworm. I savor being versatile and enduring challenges.

I'm currently doing my bachelor's in information technology at GRIET, Hyderabad. I have done my diploma in Mining Engineering.
Keeping that aside, I attend conferences, workshops at ISB, and other premier institutes, which will help me in upgrading my skills.
I have associated with various organizations throughout my diploma and B.tech. I have interned with SCCL, worked as an organizing committee member, ASG-Delegate relations,
Director-General for Model United Nations conferences. I'm currently the founder and president of themunnersworld(Marketing&advertising).
I volunteer with several NGO's namely youngistaan foundation,wemakechangenow,careervillage.


I'm fortunate enough  to work with various organizations that helped me broaden the canvas of my  skills. Sometimes a graphic designer, 
sometimes a social media manager, marketing, public relations, and some other times brainstorming over an idea for days, preparing presentations, 
collaborations and signing agreements, raising funds to help someone in need.
